# 217. Contains Duplicate

https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate

## Brute Force Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$  
Checking the length is constant time complexity, making the set is $O(N)$

**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
Since the space required to create the set is proportional to the number of unique elements.

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)
```
