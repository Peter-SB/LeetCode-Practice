# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

## Brute Force Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$  
This solution is a simple attempt but is slow because of the nested loop it.

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                if prices[j] - prices[i] > max_profit:
                    max_profit =  prices[j] - prices[i]

        return max_profit
```

## Two Pointer Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$  
Since we only go through once.

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

### NeatCode Solution

This is focused on finding local and global minimum. We keep track of the local minimum by sliding l along whenever there is a new lowest point. Each time we don't find a minimum, we check if the new point creates a profit greater than what we have already found as the max profit.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 1
        max_profit = 0

        while r < len(prices):
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
            else:
                l = r
            r += 1

        return max_profit
```

### Min/Max Function Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = prices[0]

        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(price, min_price)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)

        return max_profit
```

### Even Faster

We can make this even faster by not using the min/max functions and doing a conditional check

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = prices[0]

        for price in prices:
            min_price = price if price < min_price else min_price
            max_profit = max_profit if price - min_price < max_profit else price - min_price

        return max_profit
```
