# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

## Brute Force Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$  
This solution is straightforward but slow due to the presence of a nested loop.

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                if prices[j] - prices[i] > max_profit:
                    max_profit =  prices[j] - prices[i]

        return max_profit
```

## Two Pointer Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  
Since the right pointer iterates through the array only once.

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

### NeatCode Solution

The left pointer is focused on finding and tracking local minima by sliding the pointer along when new minimum are found.

The right pointer checks for potential profits at each step.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 1
        max_profit = 0

        while r < len(prices):
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
            else:
                l = r
            r += 1

        return max_profit
```

### Min/Max Function Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = prices[0]

        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(price, min_price)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)

        return max_profit
```

### Even Faster

We can make this even faster by avoiding the overhead of using the min/max functions and instead does a conditional checks. The overall time complexity does stay the same though.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = prices[0]

        for price in prices:
            min_price = price if price < min_price else min_price
            max_profit = max_profit if price - min_price < max_profit else price - min_price

        return max_profit
```
