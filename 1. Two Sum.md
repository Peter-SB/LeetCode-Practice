# 1. Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

## Brute Force Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$  
This solution is a simple attempt but is slow because of the nested loop it.

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$  
Since no extra space is used.  
The only memory used is for the output (the indices [i, j]), which is constant (O(1)).

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
       for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target):
                    return [i,j]
```

## Hash Maps Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(N) + O(n) = O(n) $  
This solution is a simple attempt but is slow because of the nested loop it.

**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$  
In the worst case (when all elements in nums are unique), the dictionary stores n elements.  
The space required for variables (i, num, etc.) is constant

)
O(1).

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_map = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            num_map[num] = i

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if(target - nums[i] in num_map):
                if(num_map[target - nums[i]] != i):
                    return [i, num_map[target - nums[i]]]
```

### Better Solution

Checking as we go reduces the need to check against its self and also speeds up result. Same time complexity

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_map = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], i]
            num_map[num] = i
```

### Handling Duplicates:

Use an array of indicies

```python
from collections import defaultdict

num_map = defaultdict(list)
for i, num in enumerate(nums):
    num_map[num].append(i)
```
